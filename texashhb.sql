Yet these students also made decisions that had important consequences. Only a small percentage of the white students at Central High School taunted or physically harassed African American students. Still other students chose to offer small gestures of kindness, a smile or a word of encouragement. The Little Rock Nine made the most difficult choice of allâ€”choosing to enter the menacing hallways of a school that did not want them, and in so doing, putting themselves at great risk. In this activity, we will explore this range of choices, and then as a group we will discuss their implications.

Students work together to ensure that each member of the group knows the material equally well. Next, members of groups are "jigsawed," or mixed, so that new groups are formed (called "core learning groups"), each containing members representing all of the original expert groups. Each "expert" teaches fellow students his/her content. From core groups students report out, create a group project, or develop individual projects or other assessment measures (essay, timeline, visual).\r\n\r\nIn this activity, we will use an abridged version of the jigsaw to explore choices made by leaders, the media, and Little Rock citizens during the first year of desegregation at Central High School.\r\n\r\nBoth your expert group and your core group assignments for this activity can be found in the table at the bottom of this activity.', 13, NULL, NULL, NULL);

Students are prompted to join with teachers in posing problems to foster â€œcritical consciousness.â€<sup>2</sup> They are encouraged to engage in dialogue within a community of learners, to look deeply, to question underlying assumptions, and to discern underlying values being presented. <br /><br />In reflective classrooms focused on historical understanding, students are encouraged to view history as a human construction rather than an inevitable event--a dynamic process in which individuals and groups shape their destiny by the choices they make. Students study how and why events unfolded as they did, looking at how citizens can be active moral agents who can make a difference in society. Students are encouraged to view themselves as historical actors, thereby exploring how any particular case study is relevant to their own lives today.<br /><br />Finally, in reflective classrooms, teaching and learning is conceived as a social endeavor where a healthy exchange of ideas is welcome. Students are treated as thoughtful participants, encouraged to voice their own opinions and to actively listen to others; to treat different students and different perspectives with patience and respect; and to recognize that there are always more perspectives and more to learn.</span></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span size="2">Activity: Fostering a Reflective Classroom Community</span></h1>\r\n</div>\r\n<div align="left"><span style="font-size: small;" size="2"><span style="font-size: small;" size="2"></span></span>\r\n<table style="width: 95%; margin: 20px 0px;" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10" align="center" border="0">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<table cellpadding="10" cellspacing="10" border="0">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><span style="font-size: small;" size="2">1.

Students study how and why events unfolded as they did, looking at how citizens can be active moral agents who can make a difference in society. Students are encouraged to view themselves as historical actors, thereby exploring how any particular case study is relevant to their own lives today.\r\n\r\nFinally, in reflective classrooms, teaching and learning is conceived as a social endeavor where a healthy exchange of ideas is welcome.

This online workshop for educators provides content and some teaching strategies that will help students connect history to the moral questions inherent in a study not only of violence, racism, and antisemitism but also of courage, caring, and compassion.

How do I define myself? How do I define others? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We learn how identity is linked to decision-making, and we discuss the impact that choices made by individuals have on society. The journey then broadens to an exploration of identity as it relates to groups and nations. (<strong>We and They</strong>) How does a nation define itself? Who decides who belongs and who doesn''t? </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that foundation, weâ€™ll learn how issues of identity and membership, inclusion and exclusion, play out at one particular moment in <strong>history</strong>. During this part of the journey, weâ€™ll engage in a rigorous investigation of Germany''s transition from a democracy to a totalitarian regime. Weâ€™ll explore the <strong>Rise of the Nazis</strong> and how the Nazi party was able to dismantle democracy in Germany. Weâ€™ll then look at the <strong>Nazis in Power</strong> by exploring how the use of bureaucracy, in addition to propaganda and education turned neighbor against neighbor.  Weâ€™ll explore examples of obedience and conformity that set the stage for <strong>the Holocaust</strong>. Weâ€™ll discuss the factors that influence the choices of perpetrators, rescuers, resisters, and bystanders in times of genocide or collective violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout, weâ€™ll confront the moral questions inherent in this history and discover that even the smallest choices can, indeed, make a difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on the role of the individual in history, weâ€™ll then consider the question: Who was responsible? And, what are the consequences of refusing to confront the past. (<strong>Judgment, Memory and Legacy</strong>) </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, weâ€™ll reflect on our roles as citizens in a democracy, and embark on what we hope is a life-long commitment to responsible participation in the world, to continually asking, "How can I make a difference?â€ (<strong>Choosing to Participate</strong>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend that you keep a journal as you read passages, view videos, and reflect on the issues raised in these six sessions. </p> \r\n', '2014-05-14 10:15:29', '2014-05-16 11:23:43', 'OCTexasHHB', NULL);

INSERT INTO `courses` VALUES(40, 'Teaching About Pluralism and Democracy', '<p>How does Facing History and Ourselves educate students for civic engagement in a globalized world when religious identity is a flashpoint for conflict in our country and the root cause of much of the worldâ€™s violence?<p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can the world''s teachers help students deal with the new, the unfamiliar and the complex?<p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can educators do to promote tolerance, respect and understanding?<p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this symposium we will explore dilemmas of identity and belonging in a globalized world.  In the twentieth century, debates about integration often revolved around race, nationality or social class.  Increasingly, however, religion has become the focus of discussion about identity and belonging around the world, raising complex civic dilemmas and the root cause of much of the worldâ€™s violence.  In the changing global landscape, we live alongside neighbors whose beliefs and practices are often quite different than our own. Despite this new proximity, different groups often do not know much about each otherâ€™s religious traditions and cultures.  The lack of understanding about differences can fuel prejudice and hatred, undermining understanding, cooperation, and efforts to create a pluralistic society where diverse people actively and positively engage with each other, building strong bonds based on an appreciative knowledge of differences.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Exploring issues and themes of identity, civic values and pluralism in a democratic society have always been at the core of Facing History and Ourselves.   In Facing History and Ourselves classrooms, students learn that democracy, among the most fragile of human enterprises, is always a work in progress and can only remain vital through active, thoughtful and responsible participation of its citizens.  Its ideals of freedom, equality, and justice require constant vigilance and sustenance.  Those moments in history where these ideals were assaulted and democracy was put at risk, if not destroyed, need close and rigorous examination in school curriculum.  For more than 30 years, Facing History and Ourselves has believed that education is the key to combating bigotry and nurturing democracy, and that schools must foster ongoing dialogue about creating respectful pluralistic communities.  As we continue to deepen our exploration of these themes, we have engaged with distinguished scholars in our work on A Convenient Hatred: The History of Antisemitism, on the groundbreaking revision of our foundational case study Holocaust and Human Behavior, and to create other resources on religion and identity such as Stories of Identity: Religion, Migration and Belonging in a Changing World.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>This symposium will use Facing History and Ourselvesâ€™ case study method to provoke meaningful dialogue about stereotyping, scapegoating and hatred in history and in our present world.  We will use the lens of religious identity, selections from A Convenient Hatred: The History of Antisemitism, and other print and digital resources to explore issues of identity, belonging and pluralism.  The history of antisemitism, like every history, is both universal and particular and will be used to explore universal questions of identity and membership.  How is identity formed?  How do we understand difference?  Why do we divide ourselves into â€œweâ€ and â€œtheyâ€? We will also discuss how individuals and nations have used myths, especially in times of economic hardship, power struggles, natural disasters, and war, to unleash hatred, turn neighbor against neighbor, and define "difference" as alien and threatening.  In addition to our historical studies, we will be in dialogue with scholars who inform our understanding of trends of intolerance in Europe and other parts of the globe.  This gathering is for a core group of teachers who are willing to engage with new scholarship, pilot new resources, and help disseminate our ideas to other teachers.<p>\r\n\r\n<p> Facing History and Ourselves believes that educators can meet the challenges of teaching in this global age, in which we live increasingly in communities with people whose appearances, experiences and traditions strike us as different from our own.  Decades of experiences have taught us that avoiding these issues will not make them disappear. Indeed, avoidance may leave a space that is often filled by prejudice, fear and misunderstanding.  It is the role of educators to help students confront cultural differences and recognize themselves in other people''s stories and prepare to live together in an increasingly pluralistic society.<p>\r\n', '2014-06-17 07:53:11', '2014-07-18 07:48:52', 'SUMHBR2014', NULL);

In every historical period, major developments such as wars, peace treaties, and economic crises limit the freedom of individual action. Certainly for Weimar Germany defeat in World War I, the Versailles Treaty, inflation, and depression made the development and survival of democracy difficult. Yet while these factors were important, they did not doom the Republic to inevitable failure. Within the limits imposed by these major factors, numerous courses of action and results were possible and were determined by decisions and choices that individuals made. The fate of the Weimar Republic was in the hands of its leaders and its citizens. The following are some examples of some choices and decisions that shaped the history of Weimar Germany.</p>\r\n<div id="accordion">\r\n<h3>January 1919</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Friedrich Ebert decided to call in the army to put down radical workers demonstrating in the streets of Berlin, thus crushing what became known as the Spartacist Revolution. Ebertâ€™s critics argued that his actions split the left and made the Republic much more vulnerable to right-wing forces and ultimately to a Nazi takeover. His supporters argued that his action saved the Republic, kept the English, French, and Americans from occupying Germany, and gave life to coalitions between moderate socialists and pro-republican members of the middle class.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>December 1923</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Bavarian and Austrian officials made a decision that Adolf Hitler should not be declared an Austrian citizen and be deported to Austria after his arrest for trying to overthrow the German government by force in the November Munich Beer Hall Putsch. Had the bureaucrats decided for deportation, before his trial or after his release from a brief imprisonment the history of the Weimar Republic and that of much of the twentieth century might have been very different indeed.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>October 1928</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The executive committee of the German Nationalist Peopleâ€™s Party (DNVP) voted by a three-vote margin to appoint Alfred Hugenbrg as party chairman. Hugenberg, who controlled a media empire including newspapers that about 50% of Germans read, was an enemy of the Weimar Republic. Hugenberg wished to become the ruler of Germany, but his strategy called for an alliance with Hitler and the Nazis. The former Nationalist Party leader and Hugenbergâ€™s opponent Count Westarp opposed this alliance with the Nazis. Hugenberg provided Hitler with positive media coverage in â€œrespectableâ€ conservative newspapers and an introduction to industrialists and financiers who had money to spend supporting political candidates. Hitlerâ€™s alliance with Hugenberg was a necessary step on his way to power.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>October 1928 (part 2)</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>The executive committee of the Catholic Center Party chose Monsignor Ludwig Kaas to replace Wilhelm Marx as party leader. Marx was a dedicated republican and a skilled politician. Monsignor Kaas was neither. Kaas favored a more authoritarian form of government and moved the party away from its position as of strong support for the Republic. Kaas was close ally of Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII. He supported Cardinal Pacelliâ€™s desire to weaken independent national Catholic political parties and have Catholics look more directly to Rome for guidance in shaping their society. The decision of the executive committee of the Catholic Center party to appoint Kaas and change the direction of the party contributed to the failure of Weimar Democracy.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>March 1930</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Hermann MÃ¼ller the leader of the Social Democratic Party announced that his party had decided to refuse to join a new government and would prefer to be in opposition. The Social Democratic Party had been the strongest supporter of the Republic and German democracy. Unwilling to confront the challenge of dealing with the great depression the Social Democrats stayed out of the government. Their decision allowed the erosion of legislative government to take place in the period from 1930-1932 seriously weakening the Weimar Republic and contributing to its failure.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>July 20,1932</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Otto Braun, the Minister President of Prussia accepted an order suspending his Prussian State government and turning power over to the national government of Chancellor Papen and President Von Papen. Braun, a Social Democratic and the most able Weimar republican politician had headed stable coalition governments of Prussia since 1920. Under his rule Prussia had become the bulwark of the Weimar Republic. In the summer of 1932 there was street fighting between Communists and Nazis in the streets of Prussiaâ€™s capital Berlin. Using this violence, which the Prussian police were controlling, as an excuse Papen and Hindenburg decided to remove the government of Prussia claiming it could not fulfill its constitutional provision to maintain law and order. The real reason for Papen and Hindenburgâ€™s decision was to weaken the Republic and strengthen conservative and right wing forces. Otto Braun considered refusing to give up his power and calling upon his police and the workers to support his action. Deciding not to risk civil war he surrendered his government and took his case to the courts, a futile course of action. The fall of the Prussian State government is seen by many as the death bell for the Weimar Republic.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>July 31,1932</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Over thirty-seven percent of the German people cast their secret ballots for the National Socialist Party from an election list which showed 30 parties. This vote made the Nazis the most successful Party in Weimarâ€™s thirteen years. It made Hitler, who was committed to destroy the Republic and German democracy, the most popular Weimar leader. By voting for Hitler, Germans endorsed a party whose leader, in his autobiography, Mein Kampf made clear his fanatical hatred for Jews, and his desire for an expansionist aggressive foreign policy in the east.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3>January 31, 1933</h3>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>President Paul Von Hindenburg appointed Adolf Hitler Chancellor of Germany. In three months, armed with emergency dictatorial powers, Hitler would announce the death of the Weimar Republic</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>', NULL);

Having these discussions online, rather than face to face, adds another layer of complexity that we must consider together.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Here are some tips and guidelines for communicating in online discussions:</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>The Way You Communicate Affects All Participants:</h3>\r\n<p>As a participant, you are a member of an online community. Your postings can help push the group to think in new directions and create a sense of community, or they can be divisive. Try to be thoughtful and sensitive in your tone. Be cautious with sarcasm and humor online, as they often don''t come across as intended. As in a face-to-face group conversation, please make a special effort to â€œlistenâ€ carefully to other participants, and as a "critical friend," post your responses kindly and thoughtfully.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Let Yourself Be Heard:</h3>\r\n<p>Don''t be afraid to speak your thoughts. Your perspective, whether it is similar to that of others in the group or different, is important.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Join the conversation.</h3>\r\n<p>Remember, the facilitator and other participants can''t read body language online to know if you''re engaged in the conversation and thinking about the content. We need to "hear" you.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Be Careful Not to Dominate the Discussion:</h3>\r\n<p>Every online group has leaders, and leaders are great. But try to be cautious about overwhelming the conversation. Share your thoughts and responses, but make sure you give room for others to respond, and that you''re letting the facilitator do his/her job as well.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Encouragement Goes a Long Way:</h3>\r\n<p>Comments in the discussion can be either substantial, thought-provoking reflections or simple words of encouragement to other participants. They can push other participants to think further, or simply just say "Nicely put," or "I agree."</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Brevity!</h3>\r\n<p>Everyone already has a lot to read. As you''re writing your messages, remember that we want to hear what you have to say but if it takes you too long to say it, other participants might not be able to read the whole thing.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Patience:</h3>\r\n<p>Online asynchronous (i.e., not at the same time) discussion is a new mode of communication for most of us. There will be times when you post to a discussion and no one responds to that post, or a response comes many hours or even days later. This is the nature of an online discussion. Know that even though your post may not get a response, you can rest assured that many participants have read the post.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Email vs. Discussion Board:</h3>\r\n<p>As a general rule, use the Discussions for all workshop communication. Email should only be used to share an issue of concern or private matter with the workshop facilitators or another participant. Email should also be used to communicate about issues unrelated to specific workshop content.</p>');
